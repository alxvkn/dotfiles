    ~/.config/sway/autoname-workspaces.py

    # Sway's "exec" command has one not that much documented feature:
    #   If exact process that was started with it creates a window
    #   then the window will be placed on workspace that was focused when it was called
    # And if line starting foot server looks like this:
    #       exec foot --server
    # This creates unpleasant situation with
    # first (after sway startup) footclient window always
    # being created on the first workspace,
    # no matter which one is focused at the moment.
    # With all this in mind we can just append and ampersand
    foot --server &
